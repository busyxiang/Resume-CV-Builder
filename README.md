# Resume-CV-Builder

## Get started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Notes

There is still some minor issues regarding the visuals when it scales down and export to a PDF file. Will work on it when have free time.
